## üöÄ Getting Started

Run the monitor automatically on GitHub's servers for free! Perfect for 24/7 monitoring without keeping your computer on.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/danishayman/usm-elearning-announcement-bot)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right
3. This creates your own copy of the project

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Repository Secrets

Secrets keep your credentials secure in GitHub Actions.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top menu bar)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret** button
5. Add these 4 secrets one by one:

| `USM_EMAIL` | Your USM email | `student@student.usm.my` |
| `USM_PASSWORD` | Your USM password | `YourPassword123` |
| `SMTP_USER` | Your email for notifications | `yourname@gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Gmail App Password (see setup below) | `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` |

**How to add each secret:**
- Click "New repository secret"
- Enter the **Name** (e.g., `USM_EMAIL`)
- Enter the **Value** (your actual credential)
- Click "Add secret"
- Repeat for all 4 secrets

#### üìß Getting Your Gmail App Password

Before adding the `SMTP_PASS` secret, you need to generate a Gmail App Password:

4. Click "Generate"
5. Copy the 16-character password
6. Use this as your `SMTP_PASS` secret value

#### üì¨ Force Notifications for Self-Sent Mail (Optional)

If using the same Gmail for both sending and receiving, create a filter to ensure notifications:

1. Go to Gmail ‚Üí Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí **Filters and Blocked Addresses**
2. **Create a new filter** with:
   - **From:** your_email@gmail.com
   - **To:** your_email@gmail.com
3. Apply these actions:
   - ‚úÖ Mark as important
   - ‚úÖ Never send it to Spam
   - ‚úÖ Categorize as: Primary

This ensures you get notified for all announcements!

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable GitHub Actions

The workflow file is already included in the repository (`.github/workflows/check.yml`).

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. If prompted, click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
3. You should see the **"USM eLearning Monitor"** workflow listed

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your Setup

6. Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
7. Check your email for any new announcements!

#### üìÖ Schedule Customization

The default schedule runs every 30 minutes. To change this, edit the `cron` line in the workflow file:

```yaml
# Every 15 minutes
- cron: '*/15 * * * *'

# Every hour
- cron: '0 * * * *'

# Every 2 hours
- cron: '0 */2 * * *'

# Every day at 8 AM UTC
- cron: '0 8 * * *'
```

**Note:** GitHub Actions may delay scheduled runs by 3-10 minutes during peak times.

#### üîç Monitoring Your Workflow
